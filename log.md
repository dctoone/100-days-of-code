# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 June 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Applied Visiual Design on FreeCodeCamp Lesson 10 - 26
                      Learning how to use GitHub to log my progress and managed to fork the 100 days of code instructions and log

**Thoughts**: Struggled on lesson 10 but only because I have been away for a time. The key is consistency
